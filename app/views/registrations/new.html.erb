    <h3>Another site, Another Password?</h3>
    <p>Oauth is awesome, but it's good to have a backup. If you connect your account with Twitter or/and Facebook, you'll be able to login from there, or use your email/password if they're down or your account is inaccessible.</p>
    <p><strong>Passwords</strong> are encrypted with a one-way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(Unix)#Blowfish-based_scheme">bcrypt</a> for passwords, with good password filtering at a logging level, so they're secure.</p>
